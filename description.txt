 This code initializes a microcontroller and monitors a button press duration. 
Three LEDs connected to RB1, RB2, and RB3 indicate short, medium, and long button presses, respectively. 
The program checks RB0 for button presses, lighting up the appropriate LED based on the press duration. 
After each press, there's a 3-second delay before resetting the LEDs.
